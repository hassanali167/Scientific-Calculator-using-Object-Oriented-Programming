# Scientific Calculator using Object-Oriented Programming

This project is a simple scientific calculator developed using C++ with object-oriented programming techniques.
It was created as part of a second-semester project.


## **Features**
**Simple Functions:** Basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and percentage.
**Trigonometric Functions:** Sin, cos, tan, and their inverse functions.
**Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** Perform calculations involving exponentials and logarithms.


## **Classes and Structure**
ScientificCalculator (Base Class): An abstract class defining the interface for all calculator functions.
SimpleFunctions (Derived Class): Handles basic arithmetic operations.
TrigFunctions (Derived Class): Handles trigonometric operations.
ExponentialFunctions (Derived Class): Handles exponential and logarithmic calculations.


## **How to Use**
Menu-Driven Interface: The calculator is operated through a text-based menu, where users can choose different operations.
Input: Users can enter one or more values depending on the operation selected.
Output: The result of the calculation is displayed after the operation is performed.


## **How to Compile and Run**
To compile the program, use a C++ compiler like g++ for the Linux or use the DEV-c++ for the window:

g++ -o calculator project-oop.cpp
./calculator



## **License**
This project is for educational purposes.
